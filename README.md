#Userlib/wtlib
This repository contains the userlib/wtlib contributions for VnmrJ as
packaged in VnmrJ 4.2

##NOTES & CAUTIONS
* Many of these contributions were incorporated into the core VnmrJ
software years ago, so may be redundant with core capabilities
* Most of the contributions are obsolete.
* Though many contributions work, there is often a better way of doing
things in the more modern software
* These contributions are not guaranteed to work
* These tools may work on some systems but not others. Many will only
work with certain versions of VnmrJ, VNMR, RHEL, or Solaris.
* Use these tools at your own risk. Some of them, such as pulse sequences,
could potentially damage hardware, and neither Agilent nor UO is
responsible for such damage.
* Though this is the User Library, users' contributions are mixed
with those from Varian and Agilent staff. On Spinsights, similar
Agilent-provided materials like Chempack are available in Toolkit, and
shared materials from users/customers are here in User Library. Agilent
staff still do contribute to the currently active User Library, but,
like all other contributions, those are personal materials that they
have developed and find useful, and they are not officially supported by
Agilent or guaranteed to work.
* The last update to this file was performed on February 1, 2013, and it
will not be updated again.
* This initially should only contain contributions from Agilent and/or
Varian but your contributions are welcome
